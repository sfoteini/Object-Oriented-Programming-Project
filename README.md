The coding project **Student Campus - AUTH Edition** (in greek Φοιτητούπολη) is a variation of the well known game Monopoly. This assignment was part of the course Object Oriented Programming (Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, 2nd semester).

The purpose of this project is to build a game similar to Monopoly using the C++ programming language and utilizing basic Object Oriented Programming principles.

* **Task 1**: Creation of a UML class diagram for the project
* **Task 2**: Implementation of basic classes and functions in C ++
* **task 3**: Implementation of inheritance and advanced functions in C ++
* **Task 4**: Implementation of virtual functions in C ++
